        <p>The defassa waterbuck is a large, robust animal with long, shaggy hair and a brown-gray coat that emits an oily secretion from its sweat glands, which acts as a water repellent. It also has large, rounded ears and white patches above the eyes, and around the nose and mouth and throat. The common waterbuck has a conspicuous white ring encircling a dark rump, while the defassa has wide white patches on either side of the rump. Male:  Males are generally about 25% larger than the females. Only males have horns, prominently ringed and as long as 100 cm (40 in.). The horns are widely spaced and curve gracefully back and up.</p>

                <h2>Common Waterbuck</h2>
                <img src="common_waterbuck.jpg" alt="common waterbuck" width="280">
                <p>The Common Waterbuck (Kobus ellipsiprymnus), is a large antelope species, that can be found in sub-Saharan Africa in Savanna grasslands, woodlands and riverine woodlands, but always near water.
                    To helps protect it from predators the waterbuck has the eyes located on the side of their head, this provides a great range of vision, even when they are head down grazing.
                    The horns, which are only present in males, are relatively long, from 50 to 100 cm in length, they are ringed and have a sickle or crescent shape. 
                    The Common Waterbuck has sweat glands that produce an oily secretion believed to be used for waterproofing, but that makes for an unpleasant odor, functioning as a warning for predators to choose other prey.
                    In Kenya, the common waterbuck lives east of Rift Valley (Samburu, Tsavo, Meru etc) while the Defassa waterbuck lives west of this limit : Masai Mara, Naivasha, Nakuru, Aberdare etc.
